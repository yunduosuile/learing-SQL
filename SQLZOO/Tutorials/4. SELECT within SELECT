world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)

1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'

SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world
                    WHERE name = 'Russia')
                    
SELECT w1.name
FROM world AS w1, world AS w2
WHERE w2.name = 'Russia' AND  w1.population > w2.population              


2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'

SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND GDP/population > (SELECT GDP/population 
                                                 FROM world
                                                 WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')

SELECT w1.name
FROM world AS w1, world AS w2
WHERE w1.continent = 'Europe' AND w1.gdp/w1.population > w2.gdp/w2.population AND w2.name = 'United Kingdom'


3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country

SELECT name, continent 
FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent 
                    FROM world
                    WHERE name IN ('Argentina','Australia'))
ORDER BY name

SELECT w1.name, w1.continent
FROM world AS w1, world AS w2
WHERE (w2.name IN ('Argentina','Australia')) AND w1.continent = w2.continent
ORDER BY name


4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population

SELECT name, population 
FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population 
                    FROM world 
                    WHERE name = 'Canada') AND population < (SELECT population 
                                                             FROM world 
                                                             WHERE name = 'Poland')
# BETWEEN是包括边界的 这里不能使用BETWEEN

SELECT w1.name, w1.population
FROM world AS w1, world AS w2, world AS w3
WHERE (w1.population < w2.population AND w2.name = 'Poland') AND (w1.population > w3.population AND w3.name = 'Canada')


5. Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany

SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(100*population/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'),0),'%') AS population
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
# CONCAT用来连接不同的部分, ROUND控制小数位数


6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp 
                FROM world
                WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp > 0) 
# ALL的意思很显然, gdp > 0 是为了避免NULL值

SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp > (SELECT max(gdp)
             FROM world
             WHERE continent = 'Europe')   
# 这里可以用MAX函数, 也可以用ORDER BY和LIMIT进行限制


7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

SELECT continent, name, area 
FROM world x
WHERE area >= ALL(SELECT area 
                  FROM world y
                  WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND area > 0)
       
SELECT continent, name, area
FROM world AS w1
WHERE area = (SELECT max(area)
              FROM world AS w2
              WHERE w1.continent = w2.continent)
              
             
8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

SELECT continent, name
FROM world x
WHERE name = (SELECT name 
              FROM world y
              WHERE x.continent = y.continent
              ORDER BY name
              LIMIT 1)
             
9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these
continents. Show name, continent and population.

SELECT name, continent, population
FROM world x
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent 
                    FROM world y
                    WHERE 25000000 >= ALL(SELECT population 
                                          FROM world z
                                          WHERE y.continent = z.continent))

SELECT name, continent, population
FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent
                    FROM world AS w1
                    WHERE (SELECT max(population)
                           FROM world AS w2
                           WHERE w1.continent = w2.continent) < 25000000)


10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries 
and continents.

SELECT name, continent
FROM world x
WHERE population > ALL(SELECT 3*population 
                       FROM world y
                       WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND x.population <> y.population)

SELECT name, continent
FROM world AS w1
WHERE population > (SELECT population
                    FROM world AS w2
                    WHERE w1.continent = w2.continent 
                    ORDER BY population DESC
                    LIMIT 1,1)*3     
                    
# 前四题分别使用了子查询与自联结的方式, 比较简单. 第五题子查询位于SELECT语句中, 后五题均使用了聚集函数，暂时不知道能否改成自联结, 并且需要
再做一次, 同时考虑自联结的问题.
