stops(id, name)
route(num, company, pos, stop)

1. How many stops are in the database.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM stops

2. Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'

SELECT id
FROM stops
WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart'

3. Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.

SELECT id, name
FROM stops JOIN route
ON route.stop = stops.id
WHERE num = 4 AND company = 'LRT'

4. 

SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route
WHERE stop = 149 OR stop = 53
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING count(*) = 2

5.

SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 AND b.stop = 149

6. 

SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name = 'London Road'

7. Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith').

SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b 
ON a.num = b.num AND a.company = b.company
WHERE a.stop = 115 AND b.stop = 137 

8. Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross'

SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b 
ON a.num = b.num AND a.company = b.company 
JOIN stops stopa ON a.stop = stopa.id 
JOIN stops stopb ON b.stop = stopb.id 
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name = 'Tollcross'

9. Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, 
   including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.

SELECT DISTINCT stopa.name, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b
ON a.num = b.num AND a.company = b.company
JOIN stops stopa ON stopa.id = a.stop
JOIN stops stopb ON stopb.id = b.stop
WHERE stopb.name = 'Craiglockhart' AND a.company = 'LRT'

10. Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
    Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
    and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

SELECT DISTINCT t1.num, t1.company, t1.name, t2.num, t2.company
FROM (SELECT a.num, a.company, stopb.name
      FROM route a JOIN stops stopa
      ON a.stop = stopa.id JOIN route b
      ON a.num = b.num AND a.company = b.company JOIN stops stopb
      ON stopb.id = b.stop 
      WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') AS t1
JOIN (SELECT d.num, d.company, stopc.name
      FROM route c JOIN stops stopc
      ON c.stop = stopc.id JOIN route d
      ON c.num = d.num AND c.company = d.company JOIN stops stopd
      ON stopd.id = d.stop 
      WHERE stopd.name = 'Lochend') AS t2 
ON t1.name = t2.name
ORDER BY t1.num, t1.name, t2.num

# 前3题较简单, 4-6题均为在给定的语句上做修改, 也较容易, 第10题将使用子查询两个表联结起来即可.
