8.
SELECT DISTINCT player 
FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id = goal.matchid)
WHERE (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER') AND teamid != 'GER'
# DISTINCT表示不同的 排除了相同项

SELECT DISTINCT player

9.
SELECT teamname, COUNT(gtime)
FROM eteam JOIN goal ON (goal.teamid = eteam.id)
GROUP BY teamname
# 使用聚合函数 必须有GROUP BY来限制其他项

SELECT teamname, COUNT(gtime)
FROM eteam, goal
WHERE goal.teamid = eteam.id
GROUP BY teamname 

10.
